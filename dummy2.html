        <p>1 Introduction
            The promise of deep learning is to discover rich, hierarchical models [2] that represent probability
            distributions over the kinds of data encountered in artificial intelligence applications, such as natural
            images, audio waveforms containing speech, and symbols in natural language corpora. So far, the
            most striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models, usually those that
            map a high-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label [14, 20]. These striking successes have
            primarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units
            [17, 8, 9] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient . Deep generative models have had less
            of an impact, due to the difficulty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that
            arise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difficulty of leveraging
            the benefits of piecewise linear units in the generative context. We propose a new generative model
            estimation procedure that sidesteps these difficulties. 1
            In the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a
            discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the
            data distribution. The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters,
            trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is
            analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives
            both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine
            articles.</p>
